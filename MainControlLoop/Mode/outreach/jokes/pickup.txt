I hope you know CPR, because you just took my breath away!
So, aside from taking my breath away, what do you do for a living?
I ought to complain to Spotify for you not being named this week’s hottest single.
Are you a parking ticket? ‘Cause you’ve got ‘fine’ written all over you.
Your eyes are like the ocean; I could swim in them all day.
If you were a vegetable, you’d be a cute-cumber.
Do you happen to have a Band-Aid? ‘Cause I scraped my knees falling for you.
I was wondering if you could tell me: If you’re here, who’s running Heaven?
If being sexy was a crime, you’d be guilty as charged.
Do you have a map? I just got lost in your eyes.
I’d like to take you to the movies, but they don’t let you bring in your own snacks.
