# pfs-rewrite

## A full flight software rewrite

The goal of this rewrite is to increase the simplicity, readability, and conciseness of the TJREVERB PFS. General structure overview is below:

1. **StateFieldRegistry** stores global variables that all parts of the PFS can access.
2. **main.py** executes **main_control_loop.py**.
3. **main_control_loop.py** iterates forever, reading input from its components and deciding what to do in each cycle.
   1. **command_registry** stores all the 3-digit codes we can send up from the ground station and the associated commands.
      1. **TST**: Test method, calls **log** and logs "Hello"
         1. **log** method writes argument to file log.txt
      2. **BVT**: Calls **eps.battery_voltage** and transmits the value to the ground station using **aprs.write** NEEDS TESTING
   2. The **run** method calls **execute** in an infinite loop.
   3. The **execute** method first reads in data from our components, then decides what to do with that information.
      1. **aprs.read** NEEDS TESTING
      2. **command_interpreter**
         1. The **command_interpreter** method takes the APRS message in the **StateFieldRegistry** (if any) and executes the command sent by the ground station if itâ€™s in the **command_registry**. Logs result using **log** method.
      3. **battery_voltage**
         1. Reads battery voltage from eps and switches to charging mode or science mode depending on value
            1. **charging_mode** disables Iridium NEEDS TESTING
            2. **science_mode** enables Iridium NEEDS TESTING
4. **aprs.py** contains all code pertaining to the APRS.
   1. The **read** method reads and returns a message received over the APRS, and adds it to the **StateFieldRegistry**. NEEDS TESTING
   2. The **write** method transmits a message through the APRS. NEEDS TESTING
   3. The **functional** method tests if the component is connected properly and responsive to commands NEEDS TESTING, NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED
5. **eps.py** contains all code pertaining to the EPS.
   1. The **components** dictionary contains a list of all components connected to the EPS and their respective PDMs
   2. The **battery_voltage** method reads and returns the current battery voltage.
   3. The **pin_on** method enables a particular component NEEDS TESTING
   4. The **pin_off** method disables a particular component NEEDS TESTING

For more details on each specific part of the PFS, refer to the comments within the code. This README will be kept as up-to-date as possible.
